# SNAP CMIP6 Utilities

This is SNAP's repo for working with CMIP6 data. Specific projects for working with these data may warrant their own repo, but for now, we can place all general CMIP6 pipelines in this repo. 

The project providing the impetus for creating this repo is SNAP's "CMIP6" project, the main yet vague goal of which is to work with climate scientists to develop products from CMIP6 outputs that are useful to stakeholders in Alaska. The first action item of this project is to compute deltas for an ensemble of models that have been identified as having skill for the region. See [the deltas pipeline notebook](deltas_pipeline.ipynb)
